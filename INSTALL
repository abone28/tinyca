1. Unpack the sources (seems like you got it already)

2. Configure the following paths for your setup. These variables 
   are located in the file tinyca itself.

@INC                    (location of the directory lib)
$init->{'opensslbin'}   (location of your openssl binary)
$init->{'templatedir'}  (location of the directory templates)
$init->{'zipbin'}       (location of your zip binary)

3. If you want to have german texts:
   Generate the file tinyca.mo from po/de.po:
   msgfmt po/de.po -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo

   If your locale is not set to german:
   export LC_ALL=de_DE
   before you call tinyca.

4. Call tinyca, use it and report bugs :-))
